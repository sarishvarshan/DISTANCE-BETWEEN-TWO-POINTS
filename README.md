# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two values from the user
### Step 2:
Assign the value of the second variable to the temporary variable
### Step 3: 
Assign the value of the first variable to the second variable
### Step 4: 
Assign the value in temporary variable to the first variable
### Step 5: 
Print both the values it would be interchanged
### Step 6:
Endthe program
### PROGRAM:

import math
x_2=4
x_1=10
y_1=6
y_2=2
d=(x_2-x_1)**2+(y_2-y_1)**2
e=math.sqrt(d)
print(f'{e:.2f}')
```
